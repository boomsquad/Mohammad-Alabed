Within the panel you have your important chunk of code to run the program.
When you start the program you see a frame with squares and circles with letters in them. The letters will be contrasting color to the 
the shape. The smiley face is created through the smileyFace.java program. When clicking a square or circle it changes it to a smiley face
with the same color the shape was. When clicking randomize it changes all the panels within the frame to random shapes with random colors.
